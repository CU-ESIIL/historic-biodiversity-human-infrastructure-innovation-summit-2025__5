**One sentence on impact:** Within 72 hours we will align a century of biodiversity observations with transportation and energy infrastructure so planners can see where ecological restoration and resilience investments matter most.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; capture at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).* 

### Our product üì£
- Interactive web map showing biodiversity hot spots versus major infrastructure corridors.
- Two-page decision brief summarizing risks, opportunities, and suggested actions.
- Slide-ready visuals that teammates can re-use for the final share-out.

### Our question(s) üì£
- Where do historic species richness and current infrastructure footprints collide or align?
- Which communities rely on the ecosystems affected by those corridors?
- What restoration or mitigation actions surface when we view these layers together?

### Hypotheses / intentions üì£
- We think that overlaying 100+ years of observations with current infrastructure will highlight conflict and co-benefit zones.
- We intend to test whether planned infrastructure upgrades overlap with areas primed for biodiversity corridors.
- We will know we‚Äôre onto something if we can flag 3‚Äì5 priority sites with supporting visuals and narratives.

### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Historic biodiversity data is rarely in the same conversation as engineering plans. Making that connection helps agencies avoid biodiversity loss, target restoration, and communicate with communities affected by both ecological change and infrastructure decisions.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: [Mapping ecological integrity across the United States](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf5472)
- Dataset portal: [GBIF historical species occurrences](https://www.gbif.org/)
- Tool/tech: [FHWA National Transportation Atlas Database](https://geodata.dot.gov/ntad/)

### Field notes / visuals

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; showcase first visuals (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).* 

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
- **GBIF occurrences (1900‚Äìpresent)** ‚Äî Filtering priority taxa and cleaning location accuracy.

  ![Pattern revealed during exploration](assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  [Raw photo location: explore_data_plot.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/historic-biodiversity-human-infrastructure-innovation-summit-2025__5/blob/main/docs/assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  *Snapshot: comparing species density against current transportation networks.*

- **Land cover & habitat connectivity layers (USGS, USFWS)** ‚Äî Documenting barriers and core habitat patches.
- **Transportation & energy corridors (DOT, EIA)** ‚Äî Pulling latest lines and planned projects for overlap analysis.

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Spatial joins between infrastructure footprints and species richness surfaces using GeoPandas.
- Corridor detection and least-cost connectivity modeling with networkx/whitebox workflows.
- Rapid storytelling dashboards (Kepler.gl / Observable) for interactive overlays.

### Challenges identified
- Temporal mismatch between historic biodiversity observations and present-day infrastructure datasets.
- Large file sizes for connectivity rasters when pushing to shared storage.
- Need a concise narrative that decision makers without GIS backgrounds can absorb quickly.

### Visuals

### Findings at a glance üì£
- Three infrastructure corridors intersect 40% of the region‚Äôs high-integrity habitat cores.
- Historic biodiversity records show species return potential in two decommissioned rail segments.
- Communities adjacent to overlap zones highlight restoration and safe-passage projects as shared priorities.
